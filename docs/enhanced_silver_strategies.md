# Enhanced Silver Layer Strategies for Bronze Medal

## Overview
This document describes the top 3 high-impact strategies implemented in the enhanced Silver layer to achieve the Bronze medal target (0.976518).

**Current Score**: 0.9684  
**Target Score**: 0.976518  
**Gap**: +0.008 (0.8%)

## Strategy 1: CatBoost-Specific Feature Engineering (+0.3-0.5% expected)

### Implementation
- **Binning**: Convert numeric features into 9 categorical bins using quantile-based discretization
- **Clustering**: K-means clustering (k=3,5,7) on feature subsets to create categorical cluster assignments
- **Power Transformations**: Yeo-Johnson transformation for highly skewed features (|skewness| > 1.0)

### Rationale
- CatBoost excels with categorical features due to its built-in target statistics
- Binning captures non-linear relationships as discrete categories
- Clustering identifies natural groupings in the data
- Power transformations normalize distributions for better model performance

### Code Usage
```python
from src.data.silver_enhanced import CatBoostFeatureEngineer

engineer = CatBoostFeatureEngineer(n_bins=9, clustering_k=[3, 5, 7])
X_transformed = engineer.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
```

## Strategy 2: Fold-Safe Target Encoding (+0.2-0.4% expected)

### Implementation
- **Target Encoding**: Encode categorical features based on target mean with smoothing
- **CV Safety**: Fit encoders within CV folds to prevent leakage
- **Regularization**: Add Gaussian noise (σ=0.01) to encoded values

### Rationale
- Target encoding captures the relationship between categories and target
- Smoothing prevents overfitting on rare categories
- Noise injection acts as regularization
- Fold-safe implementation prevents data leakage

### Code Usage
```python
from src.data.silver_enhanced import CVSafeTargetEncoder

encoder = CVSafeTargetEncoder(
    cols=['Stage_fear', 'Drained_after_socializing'],
    smoothing=1.0,
    noise_level=0.01
)
X_transformed = encoder.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
```

## Strategy 3: Advanced Statistical & Imputation Features (+0.1-0.3% expected)

### Implementation
- **KNN Imputation**: Fill missing values using k=5 nearest neighbors
- **Statistical Moments**: Row-wise mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, quantiles
- **Z-scores & Percentiles**: Feature-specific standardization and ranking
- **SMOTE**: Optional oversampling for class imbalance

### Rationale
- KNN imputation preserves local patterns better than simple mean/mode
- Statistical features capture data distribution characteristics
- Z-scores normalize features relative to their distribution
- SMOTE addresses class imbalance if present

### Code Usage
```python
from src.data.silver_enhanced import AdvancedStatisticalFeatures

engineer = AdvancedStatisticalFeatures(n_neighbors=5, use_smote=False)
X_transformed = engineer.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
```

## Combined Usage

The `EnhancedSilverPreprocessor` combines all three strategies:

```python
from src.data.silver_enhanced import EnhancedSilverPreprocessor

preprocessor = EnhancedSilverPreprocessor(
    use_catboost_features=True,
    use_target_encoding=True,
    use_statistical_features=True,
    target_cols=['Stage_fear', 'Drained_after_socializing']
)

X_enhanced = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train, y_train)
```

## Training Script

Run the enhanced Silver training:
```bash
make train-silver-enhanced
```

Or directly:
```bash
python scripts/train_silver_enhanced.py
```

## Expected Results

With all three strategies combined:
- **Feature Count**: ~100-150 features (from original ~30)
- **Expected CV Score**: 0.975-0.977
- **Training Time**: 1-2 minutes with feature generation
- **Memory Usage**: Moderate increase due to additional features

## Feature Importance Analysis

Top feature types by contribution:
1. **Binned features**: Capture non-linear patterns
2. **Target encoded**: Strong predictors for personality type
3. **Polynomial features**: Interaction effects
4. **Statistical features**: Distribution characteristics
5. **Cluster features**: Natural groupings

## Next Steps

If Bronze medal not achieved:
1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Use Optuna with 200+ trials
2. **Feature Selection**: Select top 50-70 features by importance
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine with CatBoost/XGBoost
4. **Threshold Tuning**: Optimize classification threshold
